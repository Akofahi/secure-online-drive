Secure Online Drive is a web-based file storage and management application built to securely upload, organize, and access files through a clean, modern interface.

The project focuses on authentication, access control, and structured file handling, allowing users to manage their files reliably while maintaining data separation and security. It is designed with scalability in mind and follows modern full-stack practices using a React/Next.js-based frontend and a cloud-backed backend.

This project demonstrates practical experience in frontend architecture, secure user flows, and real-world application design, rather than a demo-only prototype.
